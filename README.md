Automate search government funding opportunities and recommend those that matched with research profiles

As a researcher, we have to take tons of time to look for the right funding opportunities for our own proposals. The government funding agencies release hundreds of funding opportunities on a weekly basis. It will take a significant trunk of time to review manually. This project aims to automate the process and provide recommendations to researchers. Hopefully, it will be a helpful tool to help other researchers in their daily work lives.
